# Smart_Wheel_Chair
We are approaching in a smart way to allow the users to use the movement of hand gestures and synchronize them with the movement of the wheelchair. 
It will also give an alert on going close to some obstacle. The main objective of this project is to build a budget-friendly wheelchair that will help physically challenged 
people to travel easily without depending on others.
